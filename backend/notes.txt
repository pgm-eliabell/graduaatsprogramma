 Next:
 1) Install some missing packages:
      composer require symfony/mailer
 2) In RegistrationController::verifyUserEmail():
    * Customize the last redirectToRoute() after a successful email verification.
    * Make sure you're rendering success flash messages or change the $this->addFlash() line.
 3) Review and customize the form, controller, and templates as needed.
 4) Run "symfony console make:migration" to generate a migration for the newly added User::isVerified property.
 Then open your browser, go to "/register" and enjoy your new form!
